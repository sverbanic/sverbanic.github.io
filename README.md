## Welcome to my page.
This site is mostly here to redirect you to other places that can better address whatever it is you're looking for about me,
but I hope to update it with some other personal and professional projects in the future.


## About Me
I'm a molecular biologist that's really into using new biotechnologies to address challenging problems, but I'm also just a guy that loves backpacking, museums, skateboarding, and a strong cup of coffee. Currently, I work as postdoc in Professor Irene Chen's lab at UCLA, expanding on my previous work and helping the lab move in new directions.

I hope you find what you need below, but if not, shoot me an email at saverbanic@gmail.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm also on the job market, so if your company is looking for a hard-working, curious, innovative, and friendly new team member, please reach out.

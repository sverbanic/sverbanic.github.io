## Welcome to my page.
This site is mostly here to redirect you to other places that can better address whatever it is you're looking for about me,
but I hope to update it with some other personal and professional projects in the future.


## About Me
Simply put: I'm a research scientist. Although my degrees say 'biochemistry' and 'molecular biology' on them, I've spent much of the past decade working on interdisciplinary projects spanning from analytical chemistry and material science to bioinformatics and programming. These days, I'm most interested in bioengineering projects that utilize a combination of programming, synthetic biology, and conventional methods to solve previously intractable problems or create & discover new biological materials. I put this into practice as a Senior Scientist in the Vector Innovation Group at 4DMT, contributing to the development of next-generation AAV vectors as our group's lead bioinformatician. I've been told that 'science is 90% of my personality', and if that's true, then the other 10% loves climbing, backpacking, museums, skateboarding, word games, vinyl records, and the pursuit of making the perfect shot of espresso.

I hope you find what you need below, but if not, shoot me an email at saverbanic@gmail.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

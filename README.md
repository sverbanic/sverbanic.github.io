## Welcome to my page.
This site is mostly here to redirect you to other places that can better address whatever it is you're looking for about me,
but I hope to update it with some other personal and professional projects in the future.


## About Me
I'm (primarily) a molecular biologist that's really into using new biotechnologies to address challenging problems,
but I'm also just a guy that loves backpacking, museums, skateboarding, and a strong cup of coffee.

Currently, I'm a postdoc in Professor Irene Chen's lab at UCLA, but I'm also entering the job market.
If your company is looking for a hard-working, curious, innovative, and friendly new team member, please reach out.

I hope you find what you need below, but if not, feel free to reach out using the contact info at the bottom!
